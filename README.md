# jQuery-Ajax

AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server(in the background) and updating parts of a web page without having
to reload the page.

# What I learnt

1. Requesting text and HTML from a remote server using both HTTP Get and HTTP Post.
2. Loading external data directly into the selected HTML elements of a web page.
